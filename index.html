   <h1>who am i </h1>
   <h2><b>hi i am abdulrahman you can call me hamani i am 15 born on septrmber 18 2006</b> back when I was young I used to love drawing and robots as a kid robots were all around the world and like toys that need batteries are electronic
    
like a talking toy or an RC car and many other things but we as kids we loved playing we didn't think because we weren't conscious we were like  brained washed for just playing so now when grown up we need to take things more seriously because if we fail in the future we fail all away but if we don't give up and learn from the past and not do what we did before see before its a past so we need to adapt well me as a kid I was crazy and all but when I became 10 I wanted to know how robot work so I went to asked my dad and then my dad showed me about sumo robots then I made my small robot from ev3 I gave him a name MAX then I watched tutorials about building robots then I made my first robot then here where I was gonna give up why I learned about programming I was hard but I learned fast from youtube then made a sumo robot and I found a app called ev3 remonte on my ipad so i downloaded it then found out i can control it soo i dissambeld my sumo then made a car then buileded it and made a RC car then drove it adn i had fun it was fast and then i grew up to 12 i made my first game on scratch i had lessons on it in my computer class in 5th grade so i made a shooter game then in 14 i leared codeing in code.org after that in 15 here I am who knows what i will become inn the future hop to see you soon  </h2> <hr>
